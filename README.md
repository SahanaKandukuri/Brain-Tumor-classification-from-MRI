# Brain-Tumor-classification-from-MRI
• Objective: To develop an Image Classification ML model (in Python), to detect if a given Brain MRI scan has a  tumor in it or not • Designed the neural network with best-tried layers and achieve a high accuracy of 99% • Implemented Keras – TensorFlow packages to design the CNN architecture
